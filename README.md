# Zodiac Pair Comparison

## A MEN Stack CRUD Application

## Why I Started This
- I decided to take the GA SEI course with the immediate goal of building my company's brand new website, which is a zodiac-based friend discovery app, on my own toward the end of the course.
- A form of slot machine was already in the feature plan, and since it was also on the list of recommended games to build, I chose go with it.
- A variation of this product will be integrated into the company website in the future. 

## Getting Started
- <a href="https://chinese-zodiac-slot-machine.surge.sh/">Game Link</a>
- You need 2 players to play the game.
- Each player will choose a zodiac avatar, and play the slot machine as the selected avatar.
- Each player gets to spin the slot machine for 3 rounds.
- After three rounds of play, the player with a higher sum of scores wins. 
- Scoring system: 
  - Four of a kind - 1000 points
  - Three of a kind - 100 points 
  - Two of a kind - 10 points (two pairs - 20 points)

## Challenges
- As the app gets more developed, I keep finding more stuff to want to add or fix, but I realized that it becomes incrementally harder to do so. 
  - The design elements are all relative. 
  - Hiding/Showing elements - more difficult as more features and css were added.
  - When I change one stuff, I need to track where I hide and show the elements. 
  - At some point I felt that the return wasn't big enough to spend couple hours to fix a minor bug. 
  - I have to find a better architecture to code more efficiently for scalability. 
- Creating the scoreboard was more challenging than initially expected 
  - Should I store and display the scores separately for each player each round?
  - If i do space-around, the scoreboard alignment looks distorted until when all of the scores are uopdated. 
- Slot machine effect - it was difficult to find good reference with easy-to-follow documentation for self-implementation.
- Image size. Original size was 3000px X 3000px so when set as a backgground image, it didn't show. I thought there was something wrong with the way I coded. But I realized that it was too large that only the clear background of the image was showing on the screen, making it look like nothing was showing.
- Implementing tool tip (boostrap) was more challenging than I expected. Maybe it was because I wasn't familiar with how to use Bootstrap as a resource.
- Finding free animal sound files. The sites kept asking me to sign up right before letting me download the files. Also, it was difficult to find good rat, rabbit, and monkey sound files.

## Findings/Questions
- .target is the same level is .textContent
- innerHTML not equal to .textContent?
- Does whatever is in the textContent get automatically printed to HTML?
- What is target? just an object? can i replace it by any object?
- Are InnerHTML, innerText, textContent all on the same level?
- InnerHTML, innerText, textContent - if i assigned different strings to each. Which takes precedence?
- selecting each square to update is much easier than having one button to do all the work. 
- what does font-size: 62.5%; do?
- what does min-height do?
- what does 100vh do?
- what does view port do?
- the screen doesn't move to center when body width is defined in body css. 
- vh, vp, vw, min, max
- when do you have to pass through "evt" as a parameter for addeventlisteners?
- what does "session contents restored from 2/12/2022 at 4:20:50 PM" mean? Shown in terminal
- things like audio variable should go under variables (state) section?
- set at flex-start and then adjusting the margins is easier - than doing space-around - contrary to what i thought in the beginning.
- what's em and rem? em = 1 font size
- img src vs. div background-image for slot machine - functionally different? which is more sophisticated way?
- give padding to main rather than giving margin/padding to the elements inside. 
- // console.log(`scoreBoard: ${scoreBoard}`) // why does this print with score as textContent even though it should be cleared to "". apply time delay to see if the textContent element has been reset in HTML
- #score-board-B > .score-board-b-turn ==> why doesn't this work?
- queryselectorall didn't work - socreboard

- scoreboard box size adjust
- when the game is over there's a bug that "Player A's turn" briefly shows before the message "game is tied." 
- player shouldn't be able to click the button when the slots are still spinning. 
- on smaller screens, win/turn area shifts to the right (outside main area)
- button - can't press multiple times
- results + share  page
- sound for animals (right before pressing play())
- make a class/object for shuffle().
- sumA, sumB, playerAName, playerBName as object of objects
  - const players = { '1': { name: '', score: 0}, '-1': { name: '', score: 0 }};
  - class spin { constructor() {}}
- zodiacs of arrays to an object of objects, not array of objects?
- Make render() be the only one that updates DOM elements (view) as much as possible, or smaller function of renders. put everything into render then have that call smaller render functions or just call smaller renders from event handler functions?
- ~DOM  show / hide into functions with reasonable names.~
